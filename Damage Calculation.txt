Damage:

-- Persona 3: -- 

The damage formula for Persona 3 FES is:

The square root of ( ( Player Strength or Magic / Enemy Endurance ) * ( Player Level / Enemy Level ) * Move Damage Value ) * 7.4

The above formula disregards a random 10% swing in either direction, for example a "100 damage" calculation can be anywhere between 90 and 110 due to RNG.

In this case, Ziodyne is a 320 damage move, while God's Hand is 600. As Akihiko gets Elec Amp, his damage is further multiplied by 1.5x.

In Persona 3 and Persona 4, the damage is reduced by approximately 2/3 (The formula is 1/(1+0.5), where 0.5 is the multiplier for attack boosts, hence countering Tarukaja directly). If stacked with Tarunda on the user's attacker, the attack power is halved (1/(1+0.5+0.5)).
