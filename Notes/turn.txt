    Fear - odds of foreiting turn or fleeing the battle, greatly increased chance of being hit by a crit
    Panic - prevents afflicted from using persona skills, slightly more likely to get hit by crits
    Distress - evasion reduced to 0, more likely to be hit by crits, reduced defence, more likely to be hit by light/dark spells
    Poison - 30% of hp at the end of every turn, cannot kill
    Charm - odds of forfeiting turn, attacking allies, or healing the enemy, player has no control
    Rage - attacks enemies automatically, get 2 turns, increased attack but reduced accuracy and defence

    Cured after one turn:

NOTE:
    members of your party can join late but idk the way the game determines this and its a bit too specific of a question to find online :3

    Late joiners will be added to the turn order but skipped if they would go before the current turn.
        compare the index of the new player and if its lower than the active player add one to it
