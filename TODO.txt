        enemies are only able to wait.
    finish the skill descriptions
    

Unity Reliant:
    Evoker:
        allow the player to select teamates for helpful moves
            if using a move that affects your teamate have a different counter when you are hovering over the spell
            when hovering over the skill move the circle over your teamate 
                assign the playername to the evoker they are holding and find the location from there?
                change the name of a child object of the evoker to indicate the name?
                    gameobject.name = "player name"
        allow the player to summon their persona
        
        _Check current persona's stats
        _check status of other players
            show similar bar above the player as above the enemies
    Persona:
        Assign or let players choose a persona
        add simple animations whenever you use a skill
            base it off the element of the skill
            particle system
    Enemies:
        Create spawning systems for the enemies
        remove the enemies when they die
        Create a system for enemies to be able to attack players
            gonna need something to refresh the specific evoker of the player attacked
        show when an enemy has an ailment
    UX:
        improve circle that appears over the enemy you are selecting
        _show stat changes of the enemy you are targeting
        improve icons to show how to interact with the world
        improve hp bar above enemies

Networking:
    implement network events for more parts of the project
    create function that copies information from the preset list into a slot of the dictionary
    add functions that affect stat changes
    Sync Players who join late with all the stats of everyone else in their dictionaries
        it seems like when players join it copies the dictionary from the instance owner automatically
        maybe put them in jail until the battles over?

Ideas:
    Display a set of cards that will affect the players stats or give them a new persona.


Research:
    figure out enemy ai

        generally try to knock down your teammates by exploiting weaknesses to continue the '1 more' chain
        might try to target the protagonist but that doesnt matter here :>
        make a temp cube that simulates an enemy turn
            make a temporary script that just passes the turn with wait when its an enemy turn
