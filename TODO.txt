Known Bugs:
    spidr, caterpliler

Notes from testing:
            p3vr the display for the scroll doesnt work but the move can be changed 
            turn text is not sync
            only the initial master of the instance can scroll on skills
                i think something in displaySkills.cs is broken for the other players

    
    on join the dictionaries might not be synced up correctly
    the dictionary doesnt exactly copy from the master 
    make a functiont that requests a copy of the self dictionary from the master
    get what preset the player/shadow has
        get the stats/ailments that have changed from the preset
    getdictfrommaster()

    |
    V

    create a function that is called out exclusively to the master of the instance
    the instance master will create a json containing each players/enemies base presets and how they differ 
    ## i can have the master send a json plinK and set the new clients dictionary to that :3
    the master will then run a function that syncs this new json over the network and alerts all the other clients
    the initial getdictfrommaster() function will set a non-synced variable to true and this ensures the correct target
    the new client parses the json and creates a caught up dictionary to the master (hopefully)
    the non-synced variable is set to false at the end of this :3

General:
    add to the dictionary of preset personas and enemies
    code ailment functionality
        -Fear
        Panic
        Distress
        --Poison
        -Charm
        Rage
        -Freeze
        -Shock

        Down
        Dizzy
    ailment healing
    implement downed system
    finish passive skills
    code evasion effects on dodging and hitting
    complete the turn logic, turn.txt (made a lot of progress on this one)
        --make players not be able to act when its not their turn
        
        --implement one more! when hitting a weaknesses
        use port priority to handle speed ties.
    --add timer to skip turn of afk players?
        make them wait and pass their tur
    --implement ability to guard and wait (or just wait if im feeling lazy)
        guarding prevents you from being knocked for one hit
        enemies are only able to wait.
    finish the skill descriptions
    
    add mele weapon 
        add tripping :3

Unity Reliant:
    add test button to toggle requiring turn order to attack :3

    Evoker:
        allow the player to select teamates for helpful moves
            if using a move that affects your teamate have a different counter when you are hovering over the spell
            when hovering over the skill move the circle over your teamate 
                assign the playername to the evoker they are holding and find the location from there?
                change the name of a child object of the evoker to indicate the name?
                    gameobject.name = "player name"
                or have in the dictionary give the player an evoker id
        allow the player to summon their persona
        
        _Check current persona's stats
        _check status of other players
            show similar bar above the player as above the enemies
    Persona:
        Assign or let players choose a persona
        add simple animations whenever you use a skill
            base it off the element of the skill
            particle system
    Enemies:
        Create spawning systems for the enemies
        remove the enemies when they die
        Write enemy ai (something other than just use dia on self)
            create a new script for this :3
            
            assign the enemies to the instance master
                --have the turns be ran on the master's machine and sync to the others
        show enemy name?
        show when an enemy has an ailment
        perform an all out attack when all the enemies are downed
    UX:
        improve circle that appears over the enemy you are selecting
        _show stat changes of the enemy you are targeting
        improve icons to show how to interact with the world
        improve hp bar above enemies

Networking:
    implement network events for more parts of the project
    create function that copies information from the preset list into a slot of the dictionary
    add functions that affect stat changes
    **create function that gets the current dictionary status from the instance master

Ideas:
    Display a set of cards that will affect the players stats or give them a new persona.
